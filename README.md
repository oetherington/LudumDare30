#Seeing Double
###Ludum Dare 30 Entry
Here's my game for the 72 hour jam. I originally hoped to get this into the 48
hour compo but I had to work both days at the weekend so that wasn't going to
happen; this ended up being more of a 15 hour demo than a 72 hour game but, hey,
it was fun.

To play the game, go into submission/app/ and either run "./run" on Linux or
"java -jar SeeingDouble.jar" on any other platform.
